Welcome. My name is Abhishek Shivakumar.
I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** based in **Cambridge, United Kingdom**.
I'm also the founder and director of **Quilio**  

The work I do generally lies in the domains of **Audio Software**, **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)**, **Game Development**, and **Machine Learning**.
My GitHub is quite diverse. Although I prefer to use C++, I've had success working with many other languages as well.

Academically, I'm interested in **neurostimulation** and **audio-visual perception**. 
I've contributed to groundbreaking research, including a paper with **The Wellcome Trust**, and am currently working on several independent publications.

I spend most of my time working on the following:
- SDK to help developers build audio applications in a fraction of the time.
- Audio-visual tools to help treat tinnitus and visual snow.
- C++ toolkit to democratize machine learning in audio
