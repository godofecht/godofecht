## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** based in **Cambridge, United Kingdom**.  
My work primarily revolves around **audio software development**, **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)**, **games**, and **machine learning**.

A couple of years ago, I founded **Quilio** to meet the growing demands of the audio industry.  
Currently, I'm focused on getting the **Quilio Software Development Kit** to a suitable level for launch.

I've also contributed to research, including a paper with **The Wellcome Trust**.

Always happy to chat!
