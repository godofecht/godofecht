## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior software engineer based in Cambridge, United Kingdom.
Most of my work is in and around audio software development and DSP.

I founded Quilio a couple years ago to keep up with the demands of the audio industry.

At the moment, I'm working on getting the Quilio Software Development kit ready for launch.

Always happy to chat!
